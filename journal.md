Today I sketched the keyboard layout for my keyboard using [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/). Here is the sketch of the rows and columns
I came up with using the Keycool 84 preset. I also decided to make an ortho layout just because... why not?

![Keyboard Layout]([https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/dec5bd08f5af52c9154cb5bdf7c52178bb499688_image.png](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/9788dcd6090f269a9f224ca2d79453a6e915c539_image.png)

Through some research I found that I need specific low-profile switches and keycaps, and through some **more** research I found the specific footprints I needed. I decided on the Kailh Choc Siwtches since they're low profile and seem to be pretty cheap.

Here is the repo for the [footprints](https://github.com/daprice/keyswitches.pretty)

Through another hack-clubber, I was told that I could add a neopixel, and I might. For that, I want to be able to create a interface that allows me to set the lights for the neopixel so I can make cool designs!!

Tomorrow, I plan on creating the row column plan for the ortho layout, I did some rough planning and came to a conclusing that I will need 21 GPIO pins for the keeb and be left with 5 pins, of which 3 are going to be used for the EC11 rotary encoder, 1 for a battery led, and 1 for the neopixel
